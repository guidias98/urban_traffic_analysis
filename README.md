Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning development

This notebook covers a simple exploratory analysis over the dataset (dataset name), in addition, we shortlisted a few machine learning models to predict the slowness in traffic 
variable (0-100%). Although a very interesting dataset, its size is small (135 instances), limiting the models performance and the exploratory analysis. This notebook was built 
with self-learning purposes only, we'll be happy to have your feedback on misunderstandings and improvements. The dataset covers 135 instances, each representing 30 minute 
timeframes over the week, from Monday 14 to Friday 18.

A special thanks to Aurelien Geron, author of Hands-On Machine Learning (O'Reilly) for the book lessons that guided us through this notebook. Similary, we thank the original owner
and donors of the dataset Behavior of the urban traffic of the city of Sao Paulo in Brazil Data Set, used in this notebook: Ricardo Pinto Ferreira, Andrea Martiniano and Renato 
Jose Sassi.

This notebook was made by Guilherme Matunaga and Paris Mollo.
